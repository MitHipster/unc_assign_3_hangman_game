# Math Hangman Game

UNC Boot Camp Assignment 3 Hangman Game

## Description

Created an object-based hangman game with learning math terms as the theme. There are 72 unique math terms and definitions to play and each puzzle needs to be solved before the quadratic equation is completed. Games played, wins and losses are tracked during each session and duplicate guesses are ignored. The site was built using jQuery for DOM manipulation.
